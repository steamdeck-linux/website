A lot has happened since the Steam Deck was announced, and this community was started. We now have a:

* Wiki
* Custom Domain
* Matrix/discord
* 782 members
* Little bit of insanity
* Website (New)

You may have noticed I haven't been as active in growing this community, and I am sorry for that. I have got a new job recently and have been quite busy.

However, I am still dedicated to this project, and, as the Steam Deck still isn't out this means focusing on the Wiki.

I have seen some other wikis theme up their front page really nice. Currently the Wiki's front page is something I have cobbled together with duct tape and html tables.

I was wondering if anyone in the Community has some experience theming Media Wiki pages, and would like to help out? If so, just leave a comment on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeck_linux/comments/pgupxm/steam_deck_linux_community_update_1/), or DM me.

As well, if you have any comments, suggestions, requests etc for our community, I will be reading every comment on this post (if any are posted of course), so you will be heard.

I am going to try to do these community updates more often, although IDK how much content I will be able to squeeze.

Enjoy!
