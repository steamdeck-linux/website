The easiest way to get involved with the community is to join us on our [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#steamdeck:matrix.org) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/swpENgpu75) server (chats are bridged). Just say hi, ask questions, or even feel free to lurk about. Most news / updates will be discussed there first.

If you know a bit about Linux, and are wishing to help out on the Wiki, then please read [the contributor's guide](https://steamdecklinux.wiki/wiki/Guide:Contributor%27s_Guide). It is advised that you also join either the Matrix or Discord.

If you just want casual updates, or a place to discuss all things SteamDeck and Linux, join our [Subreddit!](https://reddit.com/r/steamdeck_linux)

If you have any questions, or need any help, reach out to Moxvallix at @moxvallix:matrix.org on Matrix, or Moxvallix#6026 on Discord.
